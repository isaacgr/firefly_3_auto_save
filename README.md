# Firefly-III Auto-Savings

## A script to automate autosavings transfers based on widthdrawls

Some banks offer 'simply savings' where some amount ($0.50, $1 etc.) is
deposited into your savings account for every transaction in your chequing
account.

This is annoying to enter everytime, so this script serves as a way to auomate
this.
